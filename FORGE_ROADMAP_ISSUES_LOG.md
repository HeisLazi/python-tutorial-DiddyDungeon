# Forge roadmap issue log

This is the persistent review log for the local Forge roadmap. Keep findings
here rather than in a disposable test directory so a workstation reset does
not erase the review trail.

## Review — 2026-09-15

Scope: the bounded PYR context bridge (`21dbae7`), challenged verdict boundary
(`4331bff`), Codex attempt recording (`b48997e`), and the follow-up Battle
submission worktree changes. Review lens: security, correctness, resource
limits, concurrency, and regression coverage.

| ID | Severity | Area | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | P1 | Verdict trust | The raw local AI terminal can still choose `correct` or `incorrect`; the server cannot prove which model produced the decision. The new submission/digest binding prevents changing the submitted answer, but provider identity remains a local trust boundary. | Open until a provider-authenticated adjudicator exists; explicitly documented, never presented as proof by itself. |
| F-002 | P1 | Context privacy | A selected secret-looking file could previously be forwarded in the PYR context. | Fixed: secret-looking paths are rejected by the context bridge. |
| F-003 | P1 | Resource limits | `bounded_file` previously read the complete file before truncating it, defeating the intended memory bound. | Fixed: the bridge reads only the bounded prefix and reports the actual file size. |
| F-004 | P2 | Portability | Git output used text decoding delegated to the host locale; non-UTF-8 output could turn a context request into a 500. | Fixed: subprocess output is decoded as UTF-8 with replacement. |
| F-005 | P2 | Rule authority | The verdict route selected raw counterattack damage instead of asking the state service to derive it. | Fixed: encounter-index damage is canonicalized in `state.py`; the route passes only the index. |
| F-006 | P2 | Submission integrity | A verdict was previously bound only to revision/mob, so a caller could claim an unrelated answer/evidence. | Fixed: one pending submission binds objective, answer digest and server-issued evidence ID; replay/mismatch fails closed. |
| F-007 | P2 | Player flow | The UI previously had no way to submit a Battle answer to the selected provider. | Fixed: Quest Journal now offers an optional answer form and sends a bounded adjudication prompt; no progression occurs until the provider calls the verdict boundary. |
| F-008 | P3 | Lifecycle | Monaco cursor-selection subscriptions were not explicitly disposed when the Forge unmounted. | Fixed: AppV2 disposes the current selection listener on unmount. |
| F-009 | P2 | Concurrency | The challenge is a single process-global slot, so two tabs or overlapping provider submissions can invalidate one another. | Open: acceptable for the current single-player local runtime; replace with account/tab-scoped challenge storage before multi-user or hosted use. |
| F-010 | P2 | Local threat model | The loopback API intentionally has no hosted user authentication; another local process can attempt to use a valid challenge while the Forge is open. | Open: retain loopback-only binding and add provider authentication before exposing this beyond the trusted workstation. |
| F-011 | P3 | Payload hardening | Context/verdict request models previously had no field-size limits even though downstream helpers were bounded. | Fixed: request fields now have explicit Pydantic limits plus byte-level validation. |
| F-012 | P2 | Provider context | The first Battle prompt carried the answer and objective metadata but not the bounded code, terminal, git, quest, and encounter projection returned by the context bridge. | Fixed: the provider prompt now includes that bounded current projection and still excludes future encounter prompts/answers. |

### Review result

No additional critical correctness or data-loss issue was found after the
fixes above. F-001, F-009 and F-010 are deliberate trust/concurrency limits,
not hidden completion claims. They remain release gates for a hosted/provider-
authenticated Battle flow and are tracked alongside the existing two-device
mailbox acceptance gate before Tauri packaging.

### Verification recorded with this review

- WSL backend unit suite: 34 tests passing.
- Frontend source/runtime suite: 22 tests passing after the Battle form
  assertions.
- Windows Vite production build: passed after the final frontend changes.
- Existing personal `progress.json` and `tutor.py` are out of scope and must
  remain unstaged.
